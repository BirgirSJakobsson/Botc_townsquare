# Botc_townsquare

### TODO
1. Setup WS for Vuex. Vuex handles and stores state across all components.
2. Figure out what components we need for grim stuff
    1. Should be base 3 scripts.
    2. All roles for those 3. 
    3. Player array and initialized state(potentially with ways of changing said state).
    4. Host stuff(Host/player/spectator)

I'm sure we'll figure this out.
