Restructuring Modules to Stores
Vuex has the concept of a single store with multiple modules. These modules can optionally be namespaced and even nested within each other.

The easiest way to transition that concept to be used with Pinia is that each module you used previously is now a store. Each store requires an id which is similar to a namespace in Vuex. This means that each store is namespaced by design. Nested modules can also each become their own store. Stores that depend on each other will simply import the other store.

How you choose to restructure your Vuex modules into Pinia stores is entirely up to you, but here is one suggestion:

bash
# Vuex example (assuming namespaced modules)
src
└── store
    ├── index.js           # Initializes Vuex, imports modules
    └── modules
        ├── module1.js     # 'module1' namespace
        └── nested
            ├── index.js   # 'nested' namespace, imports module2 & module3
            ├── module2.js # 'nested/module2' namespace
            └── module3.js # 'nested/module3' namespace

# Pinia equivalent, note ids match previous namespaces
src
└── stores
    ├── index.js          # (Optional) Initializes Pinia, does not import stores
    ├── module1.js        # 'module1' id
    ├── nested-module2.js # 'nestedModule2' id
    ├── nested-module3.js # 'nestedModule3' id
    └── nested.js         # 'nested' id
This creates a flat structure for stores but also preserves the previous namespacing with equivalent ids. If you had some state/getters/actions/mutations in the root of the store (in the store/index.js file of Vuex) you may wish to create another store called something like root which holds all that information.

The directory for Pinia is generally called stores instead of store. This is to emphasize that Pinia uses multiple stores, instead of a single store in Vuex.

For large projects you may wish to do this conversion module by module rather than converting everything at once. You can actually mix Pinia and Vuex together during the migration so this approach can also work and is another reason for naming the Pinia directory stores instead.
